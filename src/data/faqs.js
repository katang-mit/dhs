    question: 'What is the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and how does it affect my eligibility?',
    answer: 'The Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is an income measure used by the government to determine eligibility for health coverage programs. Your household size and annual income are compared to the FPL percentage thresholds. For example, if the FPL for a family of 4 is $30,000, and you earn $45,000, you are at 150% FPL. Different programs have different FPL thresholds: Medicaid may cover households up to 138% FPL, CHIP covers children in families up to 200% FPL, and premium subsidies may be available for households between 100-400% FPL. The FPL is adjusted annually for inflation and varies by household size.'

    question: 'What is the difference between a deductible, copay, and coinsurance?',
    answer: 'These are three different types of out-of-pocket costs:\n\n• Deductible: The amount you pay for covered services before your insurance starts paying. For example, with a $1,000 deductible, you pay the first $1,000 of covered services yourself.\n\n• Copay: A fixed amount you pay for a covered service, usually at the time of service. For example, $20 for a doctor visit or $10 for a generic prescription.\n\n• Coinsurance: Your share of costs after you\'ve met your deductible, expressed as a percentage. For example, 20% coinsurance means you pay 20% and insurance pays 80%.\n\nExample: If you have a $1,000 deductible and 20% coinsurance, and you need a $5,000 surgery, you\'d pay the first $1,000 (deductible), then 20% of the remaining $4,000 ($800), for a total of $1,800. Your insurance covers the remaining $3,200.'

    category: 'Coverage Details',
    question: 'What is an out-of-pocket maximum and why is it important?',
    answer: 'The out-of-pocket maximum is the most you\'ll pay for covered services in a plan year. Once you reach this limit, your insurance pays 100% of covered services for the rest of the year. This includes deductibles, copays, and coinsurance, but typically does NOT include your monthly premiums or services not covered by your plan.\n\nFor example, if your out-of-pocket max is $5,000 and you have significant medical expenses, once you\'ve paid $5,000 in deductibles, copays, and coinsurance, all additional covered services are free. This protection is crucial if you have chronic conditions, need surgery, or have unexpected health emergencies. It provides financial security by capping your annual healthcare costs.'

    category: 'Plan Types',
    question: 'What is the difference between HMO, PPO, and EPO health plans?',
    answer: 'These are different types of managed care plans:\n\n• HMO (Health Maintenance Organization): You must choose a primary care physician (PCP) who coordinates all your care and provides referrals to specialists. You must use in-network providers except for emergencies. Usually lowest cost but least flexible.\n\n• PPO (Preferred Provider Organization): You can see any provider without a referral, both in and out of network, though out-of-network care costs more. Most flexible but typically higher premiums.\n\n• EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization): Similar to HMO but you don\'t need referrals to see specialists. You must stay in-network except for emergencies. Middle ground between HMO and PPO.\n\nYour choice depends on whether you want flexibility (PPO), lower costs (HMO), or a balance (EPO), and whether your preferred doctors are in the plan\'s network.'

    question: 'What is the difference between Medicaid and Medicare?',
    answer: 'Though they sound similar, Medicaid and Medicare are very different programs:\n\n• Medicaid: A federal and state program providing health coverage to low-income individuals and families, regardless of age. Eligibility is based on income, household size, disability, and other factors. Coverage can include children, pregnant women, parents, seniors, and people with disabilities. Each state administers its own Medicaid program with some variations.\n\n• Medicare: A federal health insurance program primarily for people 65 and older, regardless of income. Also covers some younger people with disabilities or specific conditions (like End-Stage Renal Disease). Medicare has Parts A (hospital), B (medical), C (Medicare Advantage), and D (prescription drugs).\n\nSome people qualify for both programs (called "dual eligible") and can receive coordinated benefits from both. The key difference: Medicaid is based on income/need, Medicare is based on age/disability.'

    category: 'Coverage Details',
    question: 'What are preventive services and why are they covered at no cost?',
    answer: 'Preventive services are healthcare services designed to prevent illness or detect health problems early. Under the Affordable Care Act, most health plans must cover specific preventive services at 100% (no copay, coinsurance, or deductible) when provided by in-network providers.\n\nExamples include:\n• Annual wellness visits and checkups\n• Immunizations and vaccines\n• Cancer screenings (mammograms, colonoscopies)\n• Blood pressure and cholesterol screening\n• Diabetes and depression screening\n• Well-child visits and developmental screenings\n• Contraceptive services\n\nThese services are covered at no cost because they help detect serious conditions early when treatment is more effective and less expensive. For example, catching diabetes early can prevent costly complications. This "preventive care" approach saves money long-term for both patients and the healthcare system.'

    category: 'Special Circumstances',
    question: 'What is COBRA and when should I use it?',
    answer: 'COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) is a federal law that allows you to temporarily continue your employer-sponsored health insurance after certain "qualifying events" like job loss, reduced hours, divorce, or aging out of a parent\'s plan.\n\nKey points:\n• You can keep the same coverage for 18-36 months (depending on the qualifying event)\n• You must pay the full premium (employer and employee portions) plus a 2% administrative fee\n• You typically have 60 days to elect COBRA after losing coverage\n• COBRA is often expensive since you pay the full cost\n\nWhen to consider COBRA:\n• You\'re in the middle of treatment and need to keep your doctors\n• You\'ve already met your deductible for the year\n• You have a pre-existing condition and want to avoid coverage gaps\n• You\'re between jobs and need short-term coverage\n\nAlternative: Check if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period in the Health Insurance Marketplace, which may offer more affordable options than COBRA.'

    category: 'Enrollment',
    question: 'What is a Special Enrollment Period and what qualifies me for one?',
    answer: 'A Special Enrollment Period (SEP) is a time outside the annual Open Enrollment Period when you can enroll in health insurance due to certain life events. Normally, you can only enroll during Open Enrollment (November-January), but SEPs provide exceptions.\n\nQualifying life events include:\n• Loss of health coverage (job loss, aging off parent\'s plan, COBRA ending)\n• Changes in household (marriage, divorce, birth/adoption of child, death)\n• Changes in residence (moving to a new state or coverage area)\n• Changes in eligibility (gaining citizenship, release from incarceration)\n• Other exceptional circumstances (errors by the insurance company, disaster declarations)\n\nYou typically have 60 days from the qualifying event to enroll. You\'ll need to provide documentation proving the event occurred (marriage certificate, previous insurance termination letter, etc.). SEPs ensure you don\'t have to wait until next Open Enrollment to get coverage when circumstances change.'

    category: 'Prescriptions',
    question: 'What is a prescription drug formulary and how does it affect my costs?',
    answer: 'A formulary is your health plan\'s list of covered prescription drugs. Insurance companies negotiate prices with drug manufacturers and create tiers that affect how much you pay:\n\n• Tier 1 (Generic drugs): Lowest cost, typically $5-15 copay. These are non-brand name drugs that work the same as brand names.\n\n• Tier 2 (Preferred brand drugs): Mid-level cost, typically $30-50 copay. Brand names that the insurance company negotiated good prices for.\n\n• Tier 3 (Non-preferred brand drugs): Higher cost, typically $70-100+ copay or 25-40% coinsurance. Brand names without negotiated discounts.\n\n• Tier 4 (Specialty drugs): Highest cost, often 25-50% coinsurance. Very expensive drugs for complex conditions.\n\nDrugs not on the formulary may not be covered at all. Before enrolling, check if your medications are on the plan\'s formulary. Your doctor may need to request a "formulary exception" if your medication isn\'t covered, or you might need to try a preferred alternative first (called "step therapy").'

    category: 'Provider Networks',
    question: 'What does it mean when a provider is "in-network" vs "out-of-network"?',
    answer: 'Insurance companies contract with specific doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers to create a "network." These providers agree to accept negotiated rates for their services.\n\n• In-Network: Providers who have contracts with your insurance. They charge pre-negotiated rates, and your insurance covers a larger portion of costs. You pay lower deductibles, copays, and coinsurance.\n\n• Out-of-Network: Providers without contracts with your insurance. They can charge their full rates, and your insurance covers less (or nothing). You pay higher costs or potentially the full bill.\n\nExample: An in-network specialist visit might cost you a $40 copay, while the same out-of-network visit could cost you $150+ or the entire $300 charge.\n\nBefore getting care:\n• Check if your provider is in-network using your insurance company\'s provider directory\n• Verify your hospital, surgeon, and anesthesiologist are all in-network (for surgeries)\n• Emergency care is generally covered at in-network rates even if you go to an out-of-network ER\n• Out-of-network costs usually don\'t count toward your in-network out-of-pocket maximum'
